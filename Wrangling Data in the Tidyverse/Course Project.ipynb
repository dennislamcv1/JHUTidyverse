I am a single mother of XXXX  and was so excited to get my degree. Until I graduated and realize how much they lied to me. The school is now shut down. Can I get these loans forgiven due to being lied to and given false information that basically pressured me into enrolling. If I would have known that my student loans would have been this high.

I was under the assumption it would have been less than half of that since I had a lot of credits that transferred, not to mention this school promised me job placement, which they did not! They told me I would be making a lot more than what I do. They gave me false information. The only thing this school did for me is put me in tons of debt and lied to me. I am a single mother of XXXX  and was so excited to get my degree. Until I graduated and realize how much they lied to me. The school is now shut down.

Even after this I still use my card and PAY for my charges and have never been late however I will not pay for a charge I didn't make and refuse and Chase refuses to do anything even after many attempts and letters they write stating so.

       "2       My ex husband and myself had a mobile home ( Home Mortgage ) with XXXX XXXX back in XX/XX/XXXX. I went through a horrible divorce as my husband was using drugs and failing to pay the bills which led to my having to divorce him. The Mortgage was in both of our names. We only had the Mortgage for one year and they got the trailer bc of being unable to pay debt. I was not working at the time as I had just given birth to my first child in XX/XX/XXXX ( she is now XXXX of age ) as this happened years ago. \\n\\nNow after 21 years, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  filled a XXXX XXXX to the IRS and the IRS alerted me which caused me an adverse affect on my IRS taxes. \\nI received a l letter from the IRS XX/XX/XXXX which stated that due to DITECH Mortgage sending a XXXX with taxable income of {$17000.00}, this could cause me to have to owe the IRS {$2900.00}.

       "3                                        I was a student at XXXX XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. I accumulated XXXX of debt in student loans. This school flat out lied to me. I was under the assumption it would have been less than half of that since I had a lot of credits that transferred, not to mention this school promised me job placement, which they did not! They told me I would be making a lot more than what I do. They gave me false information. The only thing this school did for me is put me in tons of debt and lied to me. I am a single mother of XXXX  and was so excited to get my degree. Until I graduated and realize how much they lied to me. The school is now shut down. Can I get these loans forgiven due to being lied to and given false information that basically pressured me into enrolling. If I would have known that my student loans would have been this high. I would have just stayed at the XXXX college where I did my prerequisites. I feel like I fool that XXXX had done this to me.  \n",

I do not expect CITI group, or any other financial institution to be controlling the nation 's activities through such unpatriotic and un-American behavior.

I was under the assumption it would have been less than half of that since I had a lot of credits that transferred, not to mention this school promised me job placement, which they did not! They told me I would be making a lot more than what I do. They gave me false information. The only thing this school did for me is put me in tons of debt and lied to me. I am a single mother of XXXX  and was so excited to get my degree. Until I graduated and realize how much they lied to me. The school is now shut down. Can I get these loans forgiven due to being lied to and given false information that basically pressured me into enrolling. If I would have known that my student loans would have been this high. I would have just stayed at the XXXX college where I did my prerequisites. I feel like I fool that XXXX had done this to me.  \n",

       "147     There were two issues that occurred with GM Financial. I have been in contact with a customer service representative on multiple occasions without being able to come to an agreement on this matter. To summarize, GM Financial arbitrarily changed the terms in my signed lease contract and increased the monthly payment more than what was agreed to, and subsequently did not notify me of the changes in payment terms. Please see below for more details. \\n\\nFirst, per the signed lease, I agreed to pay {$460.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, followed by 35 monthly payments of {$460.00} due by the XXXX of each month. GM Financial has been billing me over the agreed amount, {$460.00} since XX/XX/XXXX. Due to this, the balance of my account has been increasing by {$6.00} every month since XX/XX/XXXX. This is because I have been auto-paying the agreed to monthly payment of {$460.00}, while GM Financial has been charging me over the agreed to monthly payment. Please note I have not agreed to any changes in the...  \n",

After getting the vehicle i looked at the \" blue book '' value and realized that i was charged {$15000.00} dollars more then the car was worth and payments almost {$500.00} a month + insurance. So when i could no longer work because of health issues. Which I relayed to the lender. And was put on a payment plan.I found myself struggling to survive. I am on XXXX now. I received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX with an offer to pay 25 % of the debt. I called and was told i would have to pay it off in 3 month. When i called back.

Even after this I still use my card and PAY for my charges and have never been late however I will not pay for a charge I didn't make and refuse and Chase refuses to do anything even after many attempts and letters they write stating so. I feel this is last step before I begin a case in     against them  \n",

I do not expect CITI group, or any other financial institution to be controlling the nation 's activities through such unpatriotic and un-American behavior. I do expect CITI group to tend to the business of their business and stay out of the business of social tyranny.  \n",

My sons a college student had his card cancelled for non use. I made a small purchase in // and paid it off. Made another small purchase in // and thought i paid it off online via wlamart.com but that seemed not to work i didn't receive a statment after that probably the mail courier.i have an apartment style mailbox system where i live. Nevertheless. So i thought all was good until credit sesame showed a past due report.i was out of town at the time. so i immediately searched walmarts payment site and paid the account in full. I also noticed that my {$400.00} account had been reduced to a mere {$110.00} just {$9.00} short of my now due payment which included aprox. {$60.00} in past due fees. So it appears that i maxed out the account by a $ 30- {$40.00} purchase. My credit dropped 47 score points from  down to . From excellent to a fair rating.  \n",
